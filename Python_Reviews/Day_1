Python already comes pre-installed in my Ubuntu 22.04

checked version running with:   python3 --version.

##TYPICALLY DAY 1 TO 3. 


In Python, the syntax refers to the rules and structure that govern the writing of valid Python code. Here's an overview of basic syntax, data types, variables, and operators in Python:

1. Syntax:
   - Python code is written in plain text files with a `.py` extension.
   - Statements are usually written one per line.
   - Blocks of code are defined by indentation (typically four spaces or a tab).

2. Data Types:
   - Python has several built-in data types, including:
     - Numeric types: int, float, complex
     - Sequence types: str, list, tuple
     - Mapping type: dict
     - Set types: set, frozenset
     - Boolean type: bool

3. Variables:
   - Variables are used to store values.
   - You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).
   - Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly.

4. Operators:
   - Arithmetic Operators:
     - Addition: +
     - Subtraction: -
     - Multiplication: *
     - Division: /
     - Modulo (remainder): %
     - Exponentiation: **

   - Assignment Operators:
     - Assign: =
     - Add and assign: +=
     - Subtract and assign: -=
     - Multiply and assign: *=
     - Divide and assign: /=
     - Modulo and assign: %=

   - Comparison Operators:
     - Equal to: ==
     - Not equal to: !=
     - Greater than: >
     - Less than: <
     - Greater than or equal to: >=
     - Less than or equal to: <=

   - Logical Operators:
     - Logical AND: and
     - Logical OR: or
     - Logical NOT: not

   - Membership Operators:
     - In: checks if a value exists in a sequence
     - Not in: checks if a value does not exist in a sequence

   - Identity Operators:
     - is: checks if two variables refer to the same object
     - is not: checks if two variables do not refer to the same object

This is just a basic overview of syntax, data types, variables, and operators in Python. 
There's much more to learn about each of these topics, including more advanced concepts and features.
